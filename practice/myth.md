The roles required to design and develop a web solution require a deep skill set and vast experience in the area of visual design, UI/interaction design, front-end development, and back-end development. Any person who can fill one or more of these 4 roles at a professional level is a rare exception to the rule.

Pragmatically, you should seek to be, or seek to hire, an expert in one of these roles (i.e. Visual Design, Interaction Design/IA, Front-end Dev, Back-end Dev). Those who claim to operate at an expert level at one or more of these roles are exceptionally rare and more than likely mythical, given modern stacks.

However, given that JavaScript has infiltrated all layers of a technology stack (e.g. React, node.js, couchDB, gulp.js etc...) finding a JS developer who can code everything is becoming less mythical (i.e. can cod the front-end, back-end, API, and Database but excluding Visual Design & Interaction Design).

###### NOTES:

The term "Full-Stack" developer has come to take on several meanings. So many, that not one meaning is clear when the term is used. Just consider the results from these two surveys.
