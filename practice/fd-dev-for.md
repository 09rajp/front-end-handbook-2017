# Front-End Developers Develop For...

> Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

> The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

A front-end developer crafts HTML, CSS, and JS that typically runs on the web platform 
(e.g. a web browser) on one of the following operating systems (aka OSs):

* Android
* Chromium
* iOS
* OS X
* Ubuntu (or some flavor of Linux)
* Windows Phone
* Windows

These operating systems typically run on one or more of the following devices:

* Desktop computer
* Laptop / Netbook computer
* Mobile phone
* Tablet
* TV
* Watch
* Things (i.e., anything you can imagine, car, refrigerator, lights, thermostat, etc.)

Generally speaking, front-end technologies can run on the aforementioned operating systems and devices using the following run time scenarios:

* A web browser (examples: [Chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox](http://outdatedbrowser.com/en)) running on an OS.
* A [headless browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser) (examples [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)) driven from a CLI running on an OS.
* A [WebView](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/)/browser tab (think iframe) embedded within a native application as a runtime with bridge to native APIs. WebView applications typically contain a UI constructed from web technologies. (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JS). (examples: [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/))
* A native application built from web tech that is interpreted at runtime with a bridge to native APIs. The UI will make use of native UI parts (e.g., iOS native controls) not web technologies. (examples: [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/))
