# Recap of Front-end Development in 2016

* The year of the UI component, and tree of UI components, for building complex UI's. 
* Components being constructed from a single file, potentially contain HTML, CSS, and JS, IN ONE FILE! No longer mainstream development blasphemy.
* React, Redux, Webpack, ECMAScript 2015 (aka ES6), and Babel gain massive adoption. These solutions rise to the top of all the polls as the most used tech.
* Developers realized, in most cases, hybrid mobile development via webviews doesn't provide enough wins.
* React Native and NativeScript start to replace hybrid webview development.
* Many abandon Gulp for NPM scripts, but Gulp remains popular.
* SASS remains a popular tool, while PostCSS (+ CSSNext) gains ground.
* Linting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (eslint replaces jshint) is a thing most developers do.
* A trend of developers abandon Sublime and Atom for Visual Studio Code begins.
* jQuery remains popular, but usage is declining.
* Vue.js continues to gain converts. Deservingly so!
* JavaScript functional programming & patterns get a lot of attention.
* Offline development & Progressive Web Apps go mainstream.
* Microsoft shows up and contributes.
* Developing native applications for windows, OSX, and linux using things like NW.js and Electron via web technologies becomes a thing.
* Angular 2 gets off the pot and most realize it will never be as mainstream as Angular 1.
* JavaScript broadly remains at the center of software technologies.
* More developers start caring about tooling (e.g. automation) and testing.
* Static site generators are taken seriously.
* CSS Grid excitement grows and the future looks bright.
* NPM gets some competition from YARN.
* The next evolution of React-like solutions shows up via Preact and inferno showcasing evolution without API change.
* Mostly people learn to not only accept JSX they can't imagine not using it.
* A workable CSS module pattern (CSS encapsulation) is actualized and used, thus CSS in JS becomes a viable solution for many.
* More people turning to UI functional/integration testing including concepts like visual CSS & RWD regression testing.
* The days of battling inconsistent browser API's are almost behind us due to a massive decline in usage and development for older versions of IE
* Most every realized they will have to have a multi-device strategy plan when development for the web
* More developer, from other languages, continue to flood the JavaScript space brining with them things like type checking and an obsession with class syntax and OOP concepts
* Front-end devs are introduced to Hot Module replacement techniques and time travel debugging
* More waiting for a native JavaScript browser module loader
* Enforcing CSS and JavaScript style conventions becomes more important (considering ES3 to ES6 code and CSS pre-processors syntactical variations)
