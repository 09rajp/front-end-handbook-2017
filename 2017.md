# In 2017 expect...

* [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/), might just peak.
* `import` might just be [usable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example) in `<scripts></scripts>`
* Universal JavaScript will continue to be allusive and hard and solutions will continue to rise that pay homage/respect to the days of [server delivered front-ends (html to the client)](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).
* Reactive programming continues to thrive in the JavaScript scene. (see MobX and RxJS).
* React will be completely re-written. (see [React Fiber](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)).
* Angular 4 (mabye even 5) is on the [roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJIMoLgqU_o&feature=youtu.be&t=6m12s) for 2017. Not kidding.
* A return to simple websites, web 1.0, but with the help of 2017 tools (i.e. [static site generation](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid))
* RESTful JSON APIs will get more competition (see [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/))
* Could be a banner year for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
* More people abandon traditional CMS tools for static site generators & API CMS tools.
* CSS grid for everyone with out a flag
* More people will move from Sass to PostCSS + cssnext
